================================================================================
END OF TEST CASES
================================================================================

NOTES FOR TESTER:
1. Each test case is designed to be run independently
2. Watch for error messages and recovery behavior
3. The system should NEVER crash - it should always re-prompt on invalid input
4. Undo/Redo should maintain state consistency
5. Switching ensembles should preserve individual ensemble states
6. All commands should provide clear feedback

EXPECTED SYSTEM BEHAVIORS:
- Invalid commands: Re-prompt with error message
- Duplicate IDs: Reject and ask for new input
- Non-existent references: Show error and continue
- Empty undo/redo stack: Show appropriate message
- Special characters: Either validate/sanitize or reject cleanly
- Long inputs: Handle gracefully without crashes
- State consistency: Maintain across all operations

TEST COVERAGE:
✓ Create Ensemble (c) - valid and invalid
✓ Switch Ensemble (s) - valid and invalid
✓ Add Musician (a) - valid and invalid
✓ Modify Musician (m) - valid and invalid
✓ Delete Musician (d) - valid and invalid
✓ Show Ensemble (se) - with data and empty
✓ List All Ensembles (sa) - multiple states
✓ Change Name (cn) - valid and invalid
✓ Undo (u) - various scenarios
✓ Redo (r) - various scenarios
✓ List History (l) - throughout workflow
✓ Exit (x) - clean exit
✓ Invalid inputs - multiple types
✓ Edge cases - empty, duplicates, boundaries
✓ State management - complex undo/redo chains
